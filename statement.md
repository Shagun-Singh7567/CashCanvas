## Problem Statement
Managing personal finances is a struggle for many students and young adults who often rely on manual tracking, scattered notes, or unreliable memory to monitor their expenses. This leads to overspending, lack of financial awareness, and difficulty understanding long-term spending patterns. There is a need for a simple, intuitive system that helps users record their daily transactions, categorize them, and visualize their financial habits without the complexity of full-scale accounting tools. CashCanvas aims to bridge this gap by providing a lightweight, user-friendly expense tracker built in Python.


## Scope of the Project
CashCanvas focuses on essential budgeting functionalities: adding, updating, and deleting transactions; viewing categorized summaries; generating monthly reports; and visualizing spending trends. The project does not include online payments, bank integrations, multi-device syncing, or real-time currency conversion. Its scope is intentionally kept simple to ensure reliable local usage, easy deployment as an executable, and smooth performance even for beginners using the application.

## Target Users
CashCanvas is designed primarily for:
1. Students who want an easy way to track their daily spendings
2. Young adults learning personal finance habits
3. Anyone looking for a lightweight, offline, privacy-friendly budget tracker. The tool especially benefits users who prefer minimal interfaces and need a local, portable solution without cloud dependency.
